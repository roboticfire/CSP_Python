#7b int returns an integer that will always  rounds down, so 7/2, is 3.5 which will round down and become a 3. Float, on the other hand, allows for numbers that are not integers to be returned, so as a result it returns the exact value of 3.5

#11 Some advantages that it provide could be that you are better able to manage and troubleshoot problems. Additionally, you would also no longer have to reread all the previous, overlapping code, thus getting rid of many chances for human error.

#12 Scratch or MIT app inventor both used brackets for the parents to hold all of the child functions.

#12 (continued) These brackets were called procedures and were able to get called later on in the code.

#13 Using a docstring could help the user become more organised when making lots of different functions. For example, if they do not know what the function does because they have too many, a docstring could help them easily know what it does without looking through the entire function.

#14 Destroying local variables after they are used are important because it allows the coder to reuse variables for other functions as well. Additionally, it could possibly get rid of errors as it is hard to keep track of all of the variables you use when creating a large program.
